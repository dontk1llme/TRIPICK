## 좋은 점
* 나라별 선택 가능
* 추가한 나라명 리스트 자동 생성
* 진짜 우리가 만질 거 별로 없음
## 아쉬운 점
* country-list 라이브러리가 영어여서 아마 우리가 데이터셋을 새로 만들어야 할 것 같음
* 취소함. 다른 라이브러리 쓰면 됨
* 아래 애로 갈아타자... 코리안 지원
* 근데 아까 쓰던 코드랑 얘 라이브러리 숫자랑 일치하는지는 모르겠음
ㄴ 안 일치함. 기존이 TW 라면 바꿀 애는 tw 임
* 기존 https://www.npmjs.com/package/country-list
* 바꿀 애 https://www.npmjs.com/package/world_countries_lists
ㄴ 왜 임포트를... 못하는 거야... Uncaught Error: Cannot find module 'world_countries_lists'


## Customizable world map

Make a quick visual list of countries (countries visited, countries to visit, countries to live and work remotely from, etc)

## How to run:

`npm i`

`npm start` => localhost:3000 (Ctrl + C to stop)

************************************

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
